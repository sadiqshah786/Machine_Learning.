# Machine Learning
 ### Arthur Smule
 --------------------------------------
 1959 ability to  perform any task without any explicitly computer program.
### Tom Michal 
-------------------------------------------
According to (ETP)Rule  Any Program learns with E (Experince) with respect to task and some perfromance measures & it can imporves according to performance measures.

#### Example 
 ##### Arthur Samuel : In 1950 Introduce the Checkers Game.
 - E   : Number of Boards played.
 - T   : Playing Checker
 - P   : Win / Loss
 
----------------------------------
## Types Of Machine Learning : 
---------------------------------------------------
- There are two main types of ML.
#### Supervised Learning :
 - Given Write Answer (labeled) to the model.
 - Already given input and Output.
 
 ### Algorithms:
 - There are two main Algorithms of SL.
 - Regression  : Model gives the Contineous result.
     - Simple Linear Regression
        - Y= mx + b 
     - Polynomial Linear Regression  / Multiple Linear Regression
       - Y = mx0 + mx1 + mx2 + .........mxn + b
       - Y=mx0 + mx1^2 + mx2^2 +.....mxn^2 + b
   
 - Classification : It gives the discrete result
     - Logistic Linear Regression
     - Desicion Tree 
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      
####  UnSupervised Learning
   - NOT given write answer to the model.
   - Model learns after forming cluster and this technique is called clustring or grouping.
